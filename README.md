# Wordle_LMU_Project
This was a small task for my studies. It was the first task of four in our course in the summer term 22. The class structure was given to me by my tutors, the main part was to implement some missing methods, the Game Class, the Shell Class and understand the code they had written. So that the wordle game as a console game would work. 

## Instructions to play the game

After the program starts 
- type "NEW" to start the game with a random english five letter word. 
- after it you have six tries to guess the word. To make a guess simply type "G <five letter word>", for example "G zombi". 
Letters that are in the solution word but not in the right position will be surrounded by normal brackets "(a)", letters that are in the word an are on the right position will be surrounded by square brackets "[a]", all other letters will not be surrounded by brackets. For example: "z [o] m (b) i". 
- If you are that type of a person, you can always type "FORFEIT" to forfeit the game.

# Wordle_LMU_Project
This was a small task for my studies. I had to implement the wordle game as a console game. 

## Instructions to play the game

After the program starts 
- type "NEW" to start the game with a random english five letter word. 
- after it you have six tries to guess the word. To make a guess simply type "G <five letter word>", for example "G zombi". 
Letters that are in the solution word but not in the right position will be surrounded by normal brackets "(a)", letters that are in the word an are on the right position will be surrounded by square brackets "[a]", all other letters will not be surrounded by brackets. For example: "z [o] m (b) i". 
- If you are that type of a person, you can always type "FORFEIT" to forfeit the game.
